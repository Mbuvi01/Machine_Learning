# EDA-on-Insurance-dataset

## Data collection
I started by importing all the neccesary liblaries that are required i.e pandas ,seaborn,numpy etc.I then imported and read the data with the code given below: data= pd.read_csv ('insurance.csv')

## Learing and understarding the data
In this stage i carried out exploratory data analysis.And i started by understading the data head,the data tail, the data shape ,the data size ,the data columns,the uniqness of the data and the type of variable contained not forgetting the data types.

## Cleaning the data
in this stage am required to remove unwanted valuess and variables from the data set and get of rid of any irregeulaties in it since such irregulaties can cause adverse effect on our results .I used the code {data.isnull().sum()} to check the missing or null values luckily my data had no null values
